# Coding Exercise

## Running Tests

I have used the Jest testing framework for unit tests and code coverage.

To run the unit tests, use the command:

`npm run test`

To check code coverage, use the command:

`npm run coverage`

Linting rules have been applied in line with @dwp/eslint-config-base, use the command:

`npm run lint`
